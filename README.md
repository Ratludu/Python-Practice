## Features

- **Structured Exercises**: Each exercise includes a description, starter code, and test cases.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Use `pytest` to validate your solutions against predefined test cases.
- **Prompt Generation**: If you're stuck, the CLI tool can generate a detailed prompt to help you seek assistance from an AI agent.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Prompts are automatically copied to your clipboard for convenience.

## Usage

### CLI Commands

The repository includes a CLI tool (`cli.py`) to manage exercises. Below are the available commands:

1. **List Exercises**:
   ```bash
   python cli.py list
   ```
   Lists all available exercises.

2. **Start an Exercise**:
   ```bash
   python cli.py start <exercise_name>
   ```
   Copies the starter code for the specified exercise to the `working_directory`.

3. **Test an Exercise**:
   ```bash
   python cli.py test <exercise_name>
   ```
   Runs the test cases for the specified exercise using `pytest`.

4. **Show Solution**:
   ```bash
   python cli.py solution <exercise_name>
   ```
   Displays the solution for the specified exercise.

5. **Show Description**:
   ```bash
   python cli.py description <exercise_name>
   ```
   Displays the description of the specified exercise.

6. **Generate Prompt**:
   ```bash
   python cli.py prompt <exercise_name>
   ```
   Generates a detailed prompt for the exercise and copies it to your clipboard. You can then paste it into your preferred LLM.
